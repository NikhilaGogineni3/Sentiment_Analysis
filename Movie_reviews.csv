The plot was thrilling and kept me on the edge of my seat.
Terrible acting and a predictable storyline.
An absolute masterpiece! The best movie of the year.
The movie was too long and boring.
Amazing special effects and stunning visuals.
The script was poorly written and the dialogue was cheesy.
A must-watch for fans of the genre.
I couldn't wait for the movie to end.
The performances were top-notch.
I don't understand the hype around this movie.
